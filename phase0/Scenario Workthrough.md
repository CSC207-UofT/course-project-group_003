# Scenario Workthrough
## _A Designed HR System for Technology Company_

> There are two kinds of user interfaces in our system.
> One is for employers/managers and another is for employee.

## Employers/Managers

- Create a new company with highest level of authority
- Promote and dismiss employees
- Pay the wages and salaries with the calculated amounts
- Check the attendences of the employees
- Distribute tasks to employees
- Assign projects and programs to teams and employees
- Check monthly/yearly KPI of each employee
- Address employee's vocations
- Check whether an employee has vaccined

## Employees

- Create an account and password inside one company
- Classified by full-time employees and part-time employees, while full-time employees are paid through monthly salaries and part-time employees are paid by hourly wage
- Check the projects and tasks assigned by manager
- Record one's KPI/working hours and wages/salaries to be paid
- Ask for the permission to any projects if appliable 

For example, there is a new startup company, called Fantastic207. John is the boss of the company and he has the highest authority "0". He has employed three full-time employees, Cathy, Luke and Andy, and one part-time employee, Lily. Four of them have their own account but only the manager, John, can assign tasks and projects to his employees. As John has the highest authority, he can check all the information inside the system from account information, to salary/wage calculation and employee's vocation. He can choose to promote any employees and give them higher authority by lowering their authority numbers in the account. Once, Luke has been promoted, with higher authority, he is able to see more information inside the company and assign tasks and projects to the employees with lower authority. As Andy has a lower authority than Luke, Luke can ask him to grab a coffee every morning for him to the office as one of the tasks. Cathy may want to apply for a vocation to relax and go to Niagara Fall, so she can use the system to submit an application to her manager, John. So John approves the Cathy's application because the system shows that Cathy has the highest KPI among the three full-time employees. Every month, the full-time employees, Luke, Andy and Cathy will be paid by the amount of the salaries while the part-time employees, Lily, will be paid weekly. Lily has just got her first vaccine, so she updated this information into the system.
